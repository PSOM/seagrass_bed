# PSOM adaptation to model flow interaction with seagrass bed

Source code for CFD simulations of flow interacting with deformable seagrass bed.

The code solves for the shape of each grass blade and uses that information to compute the drag in the two-way coupled system. 

This requires a compiled version of PSOM.
